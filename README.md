## init

Basically a place holder until i commit something worthwile. Only thing worthwile i could think of doing
was draw an ASCII Art logo for my profile. You can tell if someone is a good Dev/Hacker/General computer enthusiast
by how well they draw ASCII Art. The science is settled, so sayeth my AnectData.

Perhaps i'll start by writing a script that automates drawing ASCII Art. ASCII Inception, if you will, but only if the script
has a cool logo too. Otherwise what's the point?

### /usr/bin/skills -V

In case you're wondering if i can do other things than draw 37337 ASCII, short answer is yes. But i did pass `-V` for verbose 
so here is the more comprehensive overview. I am generally interested in and familiar with MalDev, Red Team, Purple Team,
security automation. That said i think i can pass for a Dev since among other langs i am quite familiar with `C`, `C++`, 
`Python`, `Ruby` `JS` and generally `NodeJS` and friends. And of course `Sh` and `Bash`.

I didn't say i was an expert so don't get your hopes up, also if i make a killer malware i gotta consult the cyber
Gods before i OSS something like that, right? Well that's what i was told. Personally i think if i can have a Rootkit you should
be able to have one too.

Oh i almost forgot, testing, developing, and reverse engineering malware. Has made me quite adapt at Virtualization and Container
technologies, which is an added bonus.
